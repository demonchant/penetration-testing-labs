The scan revealed hidden directories:
- /images
- /bank-transfer

## Exploitation
The `/bank-transfer` endpoint was accessed directly without authentication.

Using the account number `8881`, funds were deposited into the account.

## Impact
The account balance changed from negative to positive without authorization.
The application displayed the message:

**BANK-HACKED**

This confirms a successful exploitation of unprotected sensitive functionality.

## Vulnerability
- Broken Access Control
- Unauthenticated access to administrative functionality

## Risk
High – attackers can manipulate financial data without credentials.

## Recommendation
- Enforce authentication and authorization on all sensitive endpoints
- Restrict access to administrative functions
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
